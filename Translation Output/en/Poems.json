      "ValueInfo": "The former county of Yuzhang, the new capital of Hongdu. The stars are divided into wings and squares, and the land is connected to Henglu. Flap three rivers and bring five lakes, control barbarian Jing and lead Ou Yue. The material and heavenly treasures, the dragon light shoots the market of Niu Dou; people are talented, Xu Ru under the couch of Chen Fan. The majestic state of fog, handsome star. Taihuang pillowed the intersection of yi and summer, guests and hosts all the beauty of the southeast. Governor Yan Gong's elegant hope, Kaiji distant; Yu ¢ Xinzhou's Yi Fan, the front of the temporary residence. Ten years of vacation, winning friends like clouds; thousands of miles to welcome, high friends full of seats. The phoenix is the word of Bachelor Meng; the purple lightning and the green frost are the military treasury of General Wang. The family gentleman is the slaughterer, and the road is famous; the child does not know, he meets the victory preserved.\n\nThe time is September, the sequence belongs to the three autumn. The scribble water is exhausted and the cold pond is clear, the smoke and light are condensed and the mountains are purple. I was just like a horse on the road, visiting the scenery in Chong'a; I was on the long island of the emperor's son, and got the old hall of the celestial being. The layers of mountains towering green, up out of the sky; flying pavilion flowing Dan, down to no place. The crane and the eider arelet, the island of the lingering; the laurel hall and the orchid palace, that is, the body of the mountain range potential.\n\nPhi embroidered door, overlooking the carved ridge, the mountain plain is open to its full view, the river and the zephyr condensing its horror. The city is a home for the bell and the tripod; the barge is a stern for the green bird and the yellow dragon. The clouds cleared and the rain cleared, and the area was brightly colored. The sunset and the lone rustle fly together, and the autumn water shares the same color with the long sky. The fishing boat sings in the evening, the sound of the Pengli shore; the wild goose array frightens the cold, the sound of the broken Hengyang's pool.\n\nThe remote heart is free, and the joy is gone. The music is so refreshing and the breeze is so refreshing, the song is so slender and the white clouds are so curbed. The green bamboo in the Sui Garden, the air of the bottle of Pengze; the vermilion water in Yeh, the light of the brush of Linchuan. The four beauties are combined with the two difficulties. The four beauties are combined with the two difficulties, and we can look at the middle of the sky and enjoy the leisure time. The sky is very high, and I feel the infinity of the universe; I am sad to see the end, and I know the number of the surplus and emptiness. Looking at Chang'an under the sun, the eyes of Wu will be among the clouds. The terrain is extreme and the south is deep, the pillars of the sky are high and the north is far away. The mountains are difficult to cross, who is sad for those who have lost their way? The people who meet each other are all visitors from other countries. I have not seen the doorkeeper of the emperor.\n\nI am so sorry! The time is uneven, and fate is full of misfortunes. Feng Tang is easy to grow old, Li Guang is difficult to seal. Qu Jia Yi in Changsha, not without a saintly master; scurrying Liang Hong in Haiqu, not a lack of bright time? All depends on the gentleman to see the opportunity, to know the fate of people. The old should be strong, rather than move the heart of the white head? The poor and the stronger, do not fall down the will of the green clouds. I feel good when I drink a greedy spring, and I am still happy when I am in a dry rut. Although the North Sea is on credit, the support can be picked up; the East has passed away, the sun is not late. Meng Chang's noble and clean, empty of the feelings of serving the country; Ruan Ji rampant, will not be effected by the cries of the poor!\n\nBo, three feet of life, a scholar. I have no way to apply for the post, waiting for the weak crown of the final army; I have the intention to throw my pen, admiring the long wind of Zongcuo. He gave up his hairpin and wagon for a hundred years, and served the morning and evening for ten thousand miles. I am not the treasure tree of the Xie family, but the neighbor of the Meng family. In other days, I accompanied the carp to the court; now I am happy to hold my arm to the Dragon Gate. I feel sorry for myself for not meeting the Yang's intention; I am ashamed to play the song of flowing water since I have met the bell.\n\nOh! The resort does not last forever, and the feast is hard to come back; Lanting is gone, and Zize is in ruins. The parting words, fortunate to accept the grace of the great preserves; ascent of the high composition, is the hope of the group of public. Dare to exhaust my humble feelings, respectfully sparse short quotation; a word are assigned, four rhymes are completed. Please spill the Pan River, each pouring the clouds of the land and sea."
